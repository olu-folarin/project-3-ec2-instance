Now creating a virtual server on AWS using the Elastic Cloud Compute service (ec2) with the following config deets:

NOTE: After getting the details below from the aws ec2 service, don't launch it there. The server will be set up using terraform.

*different - ami-0cabc39acf991f4f1
Amazon Machine Image - ami-
Virtual Private Cloud (vpc) - vpc-
instance type - 
security group ->

HTTP - port 80 TCP
SSH server - 22 TCP
CIDR Block (allows access from anywhere) - ["0.0.0.0/0"]

setting the egress protocol to -1 allows all protocols.

To locate the subnet_id, got to aws:
1. search for vpc
2. select the default vpc and click subnets on the left sidebar.
3. several subnets will be displayed. choose anyone without a name.

remove the hardcoding from the http server config by using a data provider.
